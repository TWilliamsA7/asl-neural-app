# ASL Neural App

## Overview

This project is a **rewrite and restructuring** of a previous codebase to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability. The goal is to establish a modern, well-structured, and version-controlled machine learning pipeline for creating a ASL recognizing Convolutional Neural Network that is **integrated within a full stack app.**

The core focus of this repository is:
* **Modular Code:** Implementing modules within the `src/` directory for clear separation of concerns (e.g., data handling, modeling, and evaluation).
* **Reproducibility:** Using Git and a strict `requirements.txt` file to ensure consistent and reproducible environments across all execution platforms.
* **Scalable Execution:** Facilitating a seamless transition to cloud resources (like Colab's GPUs/TPUs) for heavy computation and training.
